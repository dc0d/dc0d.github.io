      <description>In a Microservice Architecture, some services update an entity. A service that updates an entity, might need to send an event to a down-stream service, to inform it about the update. The problem is, these two actions - updating a database and sending a message to a queue - can not be guaranteed to be completed transactionally. What if updating the database fails, but a message be sent to the queue?</description>

      <description>This is a work-in-progress - and will be so for some time. It is picturing how one could think about Software Development - one of many possible ways. Tradeoffs are made - the main goal here was/is to communicate.   Niklas: Something feels broken about all that code we have.
Edmond: Maybe. But aren&amp;rsquo;t you making money?
Niklas: We do. But doing anything new is hard, changing or fixing stuff is hard, everything feels so slow, so ineffective.</description>

      <description>I have stopped blogging at some point (for the third time). And many things happened during the last year, I decided to relocate to another country, experienced a multi-culture life &amp;amp; work atmosphere and tackled the ups and downs.
Maybe I write about that experience someday. And start blogging again. I do not know yet.
