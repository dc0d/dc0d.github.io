Saying Software Development is just writing code, is like saying a carpenter's job is just hammering nails.

Let's assume the design just falls out of thin air, into our hands, magically - like a sofa taking shape, on its own, while we just hammering the wood, without any need for calculations, measuring, angles, choosing the material, "blah, blah, blah" - pun intended.

We might write or edit the code once a week.

That code might be read by developers - probably even from other teams - like once a day.

And that code is running on your server thousands of times per hour.

And the first thing you want to cut the costs (time/money) on is the writing part? Seriously?
