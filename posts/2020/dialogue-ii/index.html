<h2 id="code-vs-artifact-product">Code vs Artifact (Product)</h2>
<p>Code vs Artifact (Product) dichotomy is all wrong. We are not actually selling a product - in a conventional industrial sense. We are selling functionality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Code vs <em>Execution</em>. We sell <em>Executions</em>. We make money from each and every <em>Execution</em> of the code.</p>
<p>A Software Product is just a packaging and delivery mechanism to provide that functionality to the customer. And the customer has access to that functionality at any time she/he has a need for that functionality.</p>
<p>Each Execution of the code is a demonstration of that functionality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we should think about Software Development: It&rsquo;s <em>Code vs Execution</em>. That should be <em>the base for all the judgments that we make about each step in Software Development</em>.</p>
<p>Each proper Execution means money. Each bad Execution means loss of money. Fail to improve the Execution, in an acceptable cost-window, means the absence of money - which will go to your competitor.</p>

In that process, the primary focus should be on <em>each execution</em> of that code - each time that product is being used.

<p>If your code is running 1000 times per second, it is providing value to the business - or damaging the business - 1000 times per second, 3&rsquo;600&rsquo;000 times per hour, 86&rsquo;400&rsquo;000 times per day.</p>
<p>That is a super simplified picture. There are other aspects to it that are even more &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Imagine that the code is written in a way that makes any sort of changes - from fixing a bug to adding a new feature - very hard.</p>
<p>Your rival can grow in your target market 86&rsquo;400&rsquo;000 times per day, faster than you - if her/his code has a better design and can react to changes in business requirements faster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about a code that just works.</p>
<p><em>Nothing justifies putting bad code into production - a “temporary hack” or whatever</em>. And we can come up with all sorts of colorful and creative excuses - some of them are even “professional” terms, from all departments. And yes; we can push programmers - to an extent that they don’t care anymore. Kind of like an I-am-just-following-the-orders situation, you know. To make people in charge happy. Somehow like charts and diagrams which make people happy!</p>
<p>Except: You are not deploying those charts and diagrams. You are deploying the code.</p>
<p>Code is a matter of highest value - or highest cost - which multiplies before you can give it a second thought.</p>

              <div class='text'>True. And being text is an important aspect of code. But for now, let&rsquo;s go one level up. In all programming languages, we have two sets of constructs. One set for arranging and structuring the code - like functions, classes, packages, modules, interfaces, etc - which are not performing any actions. And there is this another set of constructs that act; like assignments, conditionals, calculations, function calls, etc - the part that runs.</div>

              <div class='text'>Yes. Remember that the technical language is meant to act as a host for the business language to make it able to communicate with the non-human, alien world of technology. This is our system. If we imagine it as an onion, the business language sits at its core. The closer a layer is to the core, the more business-specific it will be. As we move toward outer layers, the language - the code - becomes more application-specific. And at the outermost layers, it&rsquo;s mostly technology-specific. The inner layers do not care about the outer layers. Because it&rsquo;s the business that dictates what we have to do. That&rsquo;s why the outer layers depend on inner layers. But the inner layers do not know anything about outer layers.</div>

              <div class='text'>Indeed. We can change the outermost layers which are basically technology-specific, without even touching the inner layers.
