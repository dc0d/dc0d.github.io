      <description>This is a work in progress. It is picturing how one could think about Software Development - one of many possible ways.     Niklas :  Something feels broken about all that code we have.   Edmond :  Maybe. But aren&amp;rsquo;t you making money?   Niklas :  We do. But doing anything new is hard, changing or fixing stuff is hard, everything feels so slow, so ineffective.</description>

      <description>I have stopped blogging at some point (for the third time). And many things happened during the last year, I decided to relocate to another country, experienced a multi-culture life &amp;amp; work atmosphere and tackled the ups and downs.
Maybe I write about that experience someday. And start blogging again. I do not know yet.
