      <description>Agile - Little Rambling  WIP - v0.0.1
 The state of things in this industry is a bit &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;complicated&amp;rdquo;. Maybe having an entry point could help.
What is Software Development? Lots of metaphors have been used to describe or define Software Development. Maybe because it has no definition yet, as of 2020.

      <description>I have stopped blogging at some point (for the third time). And many things happened during the last year, I decided to relocate to another country, experienced a multi-culture life &amp;amp; work atmosphere and tackled the ups and downs.
Maybe I write about that experience someday. And start blogging again. I do not know yet.</description>
