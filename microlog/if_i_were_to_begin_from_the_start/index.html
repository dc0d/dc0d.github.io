Wasted big time to “tech it”. Different programming languages, different technologies, different databases, “Everybody should use Haskell”, “Everybody should use NoSql”, “MamboJamboScript, is going to take over the world”, and so on and so forth.
Imagine you join a new team.

At the end of the day, if we don’t understand what we are doing, it doesn’t matter in which programming language we don’t understand what we are doing.
Or what technology and tools we use.</p><p>I would start with understanding the basic practices and becoming fluent at them. Then probably I could also make more informed decisions based on experience and in the context of the problem at hand.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></main><footer>© Copyright Notice | Kaveh Shahbazian</footer></body></html>
